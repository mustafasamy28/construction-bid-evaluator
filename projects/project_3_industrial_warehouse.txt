PROJECT: Industrial Warehouse Expansion

Project ID: TX-IW-0515-EX
Location: Houston, Texas
Building Type: Industrial warehouse/distribution center
Site: Existing facility expansion

OVERVIEW:
Expansion of existing 50,000 sq ft warehouse facility by adding 30,000 sq ft of new space and upgrading loading docks. The existing facility must remain fully operational during construction. This is a fast-track project with aggressive timeline due to upcoming peak season.

Speed and minimal disruption to operations are the highest priorities. Cost is secondary to timeline and operational continuity.

SCOPE OF WORK:
Mandatory Inclusions:
- 30,000 sq ft warehouse addition (steel frame, metal siding)
- 6 new loading dock positions with dock levelers
- Expanded parking area (50 additional spaces)
- Utility connections (electrical, water, sewer)
- Fire suppression system extension
- Security system integration

CONSTRAINTS:
Budget: Target $2.5M, flexible up to $2.8M if timeline can be accelerated
Timeline: CRITICAL - Must complete in 4 months to meet peak season deadline. Every week of delay costs $50K in lost revenue
Operational: Existing warehouse operations cannot be interrupted. Work must be phased to allow continuous truck traffic
Site: Limited staging area, must coordinate with daily operations

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
- Proven experience with occupied industrial facilities
- Ability to work around active operations
- Fast-track construction expertise
- 24/7 work capability if needed
- Strong project management for tight timelines

PRIORITIES:
Timeline is CRITICAL. We will pay premium for speed and operational continuity. Cost is less important than meeting the 4-month deadline. Contractor must demonstrate ability to work around active operations without disruption.

KNOWN RISKS:
- Weather delays (hurricane season approaching)
- Material delivery delays could impact timeline
- Coordination complexity with active operations
- Limited site access during peak hours
- Potential for cost overruns if timeline pressures increase
