OVERVIEW:
Construction of a new 8-story residential apartment complex with 120 units, ground-floor retail spaces, and underground parking. This is a ground-up construction project on a cleared site with existing utilities at property line.

The project emphasizes sustainability (targeting LEED Gold), modern amenities, and energy efficiency. Cost control is critical, but quality and sustainability certifications cannot be compromised.
