PROJECT: Commercial Renovation - Occupied Building

Project ID: LA-CR-0426-MX
Location: Downtown Los Angeles
Building Type: Mixed-use commercial (offices, retail)
Building Age: 28 years (last renovation 2009)

OVERVIEW:
Mid-size but operationally sensitive commercial renovation of an occupied mixed-use building in downtown Los Angeles. The building must remain partially operational throughout construction, with tenants present on floors 2 and 4 during weekdays.

The renovation scope includes core MEP upgrades, interior modernization, and selective structural reinforcement, with strong emphasis on safety, regulatory compliance, and schedule reliability.

While cost matters, delivery risk and operational disruption are higher priority concerns.

SCOPE OF WORK:
Mandatory Inclusions:
- Electrical rewiring (legacy copper, partial aluminum)
- HVAC system upgrade (central, floor-level units)
- Interior redesign (lobby, common areas, 3 office floors)

Conditional Items:
- Fire suppression system upgrade (required if electrical scope triggers code review)
- Seismic bracing (recommended, not explicitly mandated)
- Smart building sensors (nice-to-have, budget dependent)

CONSTRAINTS:
Budget: Target $1.2M, acceptable overrun up to 8% if risk reduction demonstrable, hard stop above $1.35M
Timeline: Target 6 months, acceptable extension 2 weeks, penalties apply beyond that
Operational: No full-day power shutdowns on weekdays, noise-intensive work restricted to weekends/nights, HVAC downtime must be staged floor-by-floor

REGULATORY:
- Must comply with California Title 24
- City permits required; approval timelines historically unpredictable
- Building has prior minor OSHA citation (resolved, but reputational sensitivity)

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
- Proven US commercial renovation experience
- Ability to manage multi-phase, occupied building projects
- Strong safety record
- Familiarity with LA city permitting processes preferred
- Local subcontractor network preferred
- History of handling legacy electrical systems is a plus

PRIORITIES:
We are willing to accept slightly higher cost and slightly longer timelines if and only if risk and disruption are demonstrably lower. Decision should consider scope completeness vs hidden exclusions, realism of timelines vs confidence levels, risk introduced by subcontracting critical paths, evidence of similar past projects, and external reputation.

KNOWN RISKS:
- One prior renovation experienced 6-week delay due to permit revisions
- Electrical infrastructure condition worse than documented
- One tenant planning lease renewal contingent on minimal disruption
- Insurance provider flagged construction risk as "moderate-high"
