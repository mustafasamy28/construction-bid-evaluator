PROJECT: Retail Store Chain Renovation

Project ID: FL-RT-0412-CH
Location: Miami, Florida (multiple locations)
Building Type: Retail chain stores
Site: 5 locations requiring simultaneous renovation

OVERVIEW:
Renovation of 5 retail store locations across Miami-Dade County. All locations must be renovated simultaneously to maintain brand consistency and minimize customer disruption. This is a standardized renovation package applied across all locations.

Cost efficiency and consistency across locations are the primary drivers. Timeline is important but secondary to cost control and quality consistency.

SCOPE OF WORK:
Mandatory Inclusions (per location):
- Interior demolition and rebuild
- New flooring, lighting, and fixtures
- Updated POS systems and electrical
- HVAC upgrades
- Exterior facade refresh
- Signage replacement
- All permits and inspections

CONSTRAINTS:
Budget: Target $800K per location ($4M total), hard cap at $4.5M total
Timeline: Target 3 months per location, staggered start dates, all complete within 6 months
Operational: Each location must close for maximum 2 weeks during renovation
Site: 5 different locations with varying local permit requirements
Standardization: All locations must have identical finishes and quality

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
- Experience with multi-location retail renovations
- Ability to manage simultaneous projects
- Standardized processes and quality control
- Local Miami-Dade County experience
- Ability to work within tight retail schedules
- Strong coordination and project management

PRIORITIES:
Cost control is critical - this is a volume project. Consistency across all 5 locations is essential. We prioritize contractors who can deliver standardized quality at competitive pricing. Timeline is important but can be adjusted if it reduces cost.

KNOWN RISKS:
- Coordinating 5 simultaneous projects adds complexity
- Local permit variations across locations
- Material availability for standardized finishes
- Weather delays (hurricane season)
- Potential for cost overruns if standardization breaks down
- Supply chain issues affecting multiple locations
